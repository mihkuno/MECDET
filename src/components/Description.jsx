The risk of heart attack or stroke may increase if used more than directed orfor longer than directed. Do not use with any other medicine containing Paracetamol,Phenylephrine or Ibuprofen (prescription or nonprescription). If the patient is not surewhether a medicine contains Paracetamol, Phenylephrine or Ibuprofen, ask a doctor.May cause drowsiness; patients should observe caution while driving or performingother tasks requiring alertness. Do not take more than the recommended dose.Allergy Alert: Ibuprofen may cause a severe allergic reaction, especially in peopleallergic to aspirin. Symptoms may include: Hives, (elevated, whitish or reddish patcheson the skin with severe itching or pricking sensations); shock (anaphylactic), ahypersensitivity reaction resulting in generalized skin lesions and itchiness, followed bylow blood pressure and often accompanied by difficulty in breathing; facial swelling; skinreddening; skin rash and skin blisters; asthma (wheezing).

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Drug Interactions</Heading>
            <Text>Do not use these products together with sympathomimetic agents (e.g., Epinephrine,etc.) and general anesthetics (e.g., Halothane, etc.) because of the possibility forincreased toxicity.Concurrent administration with medicines for depression (e.g., Amitriptyline, Imipramine,Sertraline, Moclobemide, etc.) may result in hypertensive crisis (sudden, severeincrease in blood pressure that can lead to stroke).Taking an adrenergic-blocking agent (e.g., Phenothiazine drugs, Phentolamine,Propranolol, etc.) before the administration of these products may decrease the effect ofPhenylephrine.The absorption of Paracetamol may be accelerated by Metoclopramide or Domperidoneand absorption reduced by Cholestyramine.Medicines which stimulate the enzymes responsible for the metabolic activation ofParacetamol such as medicines for convulsion (e.g., Phenobarbital, etc.) may increasesusceptibility to the harmful effects to the liver.Warfarin, a blood thinning medicine; an increase in the International Normalized Ratio(INR), which may serve as a sign of increased risk of bleeding, may be observed whenusing Paracetamol and Warfarin at the same time.Paracetamol increases the anticoagulation effect of Warfarin.Ibuprofen may interfere with the anti-platelet activity of aspirin, thus limiting aspirin'scardioprotective effect.Phenylbutazone, indomethacin, salicylates (e.g., aspirin), and other NSAIDs (e.g.,mefenamic acid, naproxen, diclofenac, ketoprofen), including COX-2 inhibitors (e.g.,celecoxib, etoricoxib), increase the risk of stomach and intestinal bleeding in patientsreceiving ibuprofen.When taken with blood thinning (anticoagulant) medicines (e.g., warfarin, dicumarol) ortogether with thrombolytic agents (e.g., streptokinase), ibuprofen may cause stomachand intestinal bleeding.
Tell the doctor about other medicines patient is taking, especially for cough, cold,allergy, pain or fever.</Text>

            <Text>Analgesic/antipyretic.</Text>
            <Text><b>Pharmacology:</b> Mechanism of Action: Paracetamol exhibits analgesic and antipyreticactivity by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. It produces analgesia by elevating the painthreshold and antipyresis through action on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center.In therapeutic doses, paracetamol's analgesic and antipyretic action is comparable tothat of aspirin. Paracetamol does not adversely affect platelet function and hemostasis</Text>
            <Text><b>Pharmacokinetics:</b> Paracetamol is rapidly and completely absorbed after oraladministration. Peak plasma concentrations occur between 15 min to 2 hrs afteringestion. The absolute oral bioavailability of paracetamol is about 80% and isindependent of dose in the range of 5-20 mg/kg.</Text>
            <Text>Paracetamol is not bound to plasma proteins to any extent. The concentrations ofparacetamol in saliva are similar to those in plasma. Concentrations in whole blood areup to 20% higher and in breast milk about 20% lower than the plasma concentration.Paracetamol crosses the placenta.</Text>
            <Text>Paracetamol is extensively metabolized in the liver and the total body clearance is about5 mL/kg/min. The clearance of paracetamol is reduced and the half-life is increased following a hepatotoxic overdose. Prolongation beyond 4 hrs usually indicatesimpending liver damage.</Text>
            <Text>Two to five percent of a therapeutic dose of paracetamol is excreted unchanged in theurine. Its renal clearance is about 10 mL/min and is weakly dependent on urine flow ratebut not on pH.</Text>

            <Text>{'Paracetamol in massive overdosage may cause hepatic toxicity in some patients. Inadults and children >12 years, hepatic toxicity may occur following ingestion of >7.5-10g over a period of ≤8 hrs. Fatalities are infrequent (<3-4% of untreated cases) and haverarely been reported with overdoses of <15 g. In children <12 years old, acuteoverdosage with paracetamol <150 mg/kg body weight have not been associated withhepatic toxicity. Early symptoms following a potentially hepatotoxic overdose mayinclude: Nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis and general malaise. Clinical and laboratoryevidence of hepatic toxicity may not be apparent until 48-72 hrs after ingestion. In adultsand children >12 years, any individual presenting with an unknown amount ofparacetamol ingested or with a questionable or unreliable history about the time ofingestion should have a plasma paracetamol level drawn and be treated withN-acetylcysteine. Results of assays for plasma paracetamol levels should not beawaited before initiating treatment with N-acetylcysteine. The following additionalprocedures are recommended: Promptly initiate gastric decontamination of thestomach. A plasma paracetamol assay should be obtained as early as possible, but no sooner than 4 hrs following ingestion. Liver function studies should be obtained initiallyand repeated at 24-hr intervals.Serious toxicity or fatalities have been extremely infrequent following acute paracetamoloverdose in young children, possibly because of differences in the way childrenmetabolize paracetamol. In children, the maximum potential amount ingested can bemore easily estimated. If >150 mg/kg or if an unknown amount of paracetamol wasingested, obtain a plasma paracetamol level as soon as possible, but no sooner than 4hrs following ingestion. If an assay cannot be obtained and the estimated paracetamolingestion exceeds 150 mg/kg, dosing with N-acetylcysteine should be initiated andcontinued for a full course of therapy.'}</Text>

            <Text>Paracetamol when taken within therapeutic levels have low incidence of side effects.Skin rashes or minor gastrointestinal disturbances have been reported. Paracetamolvery rarely aggravates bronchospasm in patients who are sensitive to aspirin and othernonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Although paracetamol does not normally producemethemoglobinemia or hemolysis even after overdosage or in patients withglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, there have been isolated reports ofthese complications.</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Drug Interactions</Heading>
            <Text>Paracetamol hepatotoxicity may be increased by drugs which induce the specificmicrosomal isoenzyme responsible for the metabolic activation of paracetamol. Despiteanecdotal reports of such interactions involving ethanol and anticonvulsants, themetabolic activation of paracetamol is not increased in regular heavy drinkers orinduced in patients taking phenobarbital or phenytoin. Chronic alcoholics seem to be atparticular risk of liver damage following overdosage of paracetamol, but the mechanismis uncertain. Acute ingestion of ethanol markedly reduces metabolic activation ofparacetamol.</Text>

            <Text><b>Pharmacology:</b> The active ingredient in Buscopan is Hyoscine-N-butylbromide, aknown antispasmodic substance. It relieves the pain by acting on the muscle spasmwhich causes the pain.</Text>
            <Text>Hyoscine-N-butylbromide (BUSCOPAN) exerts a spasmolytic action on the smoothmuscle of the gastro-intestinal, biliary and genito-urinary tracts. As a quaternaryammonium derivative, hyoscine butylbromide does not enter the central nervoussystem. Therefore, anticholinergic side effects at the central nervous system do notoccur. Peripheral anticholinergic action results from a ganglion-blocking action within thevisceral wall as well as from an anti-muscarinic activity.</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Indications/Uses</Heading>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Description</Heading>
            <Text>Each capsule contains: Sodium ascorbate (equivalent to Ascorbic Acid 500 mg) 562.4mg, Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate (equivalent to elemental Zinc 10 mg) 27.5 mg.Sodium Ascorbate is a natural and non-acidic (alkaline) form of Ascorbic Acid that hasbeen buffered (neutralized) with sodium to avoid acidity for persons with sensitivestomachs. It minimizes the negative effects of highly acidic Vitamin C like bloating,gastric and intestinal irritations. It dissolves faster for quicker absorption and stays onthe body tissue longer. Like Ascorbic Acid, Sodium Ascorbate may be beneficial ingeneral immunity boosting, helping to ward off or prevent colds and flu, assisting thehealing of wounds and aiding the body in fighting against chronic and acute infections.Ascorbic Acid is a water-soluble vitamin essential for the synthesis of collagen andintracellular material. It helps support healthy capillaries, gums, teeth and helps healwounds, burns and broken tissues. Vitamin C is considered as an antioxidant and isvital for the function of immune system. Vitamin C supplementation has been shown toreduce the severity of symptoms associated with common cold and may be helpful inpreventing respiratory Infections for people who experience physical stress.The mineral Zinc is an essential element of nutrition. It is a constituent of many enzymesystems and is present in all tissues. Zinc salts (generally zinc sulfate) are used assupplements to correct Zinc deficiency. Zinc plays an important role in growth anddevelopment, immune response, neurological function and reproduction. Zincsupplementation has been associated with improved motor development inlow-birth-weight infants and better neuropsychologic functioning. Clinical studies havefound that Zinc, combined with antioxidants, may delay progression of age-relatedmacular degeneration. Significant dietary intake of Zinc has also recently been shown toimpede the onset of flu.</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Action</Heading>
            <Text><b>Pharmacology:</b> Pharmacodynamics: Vitamin C: Ascorbic acid, a water-soluble vitamin,is essential for formation of collagen and intercellular material, and therefore necessaryfor the development of cartilage, bone, teeth and for the healing of wounds. It is also essential for the conversation from folic acid to folinic acid, facilitates iron absorptionfrom the gastro-intestinal tract and influences haemoglobin formation and erythrocytematuration.</Text>
            <Text>Zinc Sulfate (as Monohydrate): Zinc is an essential trace element involved in manyenzyme systems. Severe deficiency causes skin lesion, alopecia, diarrhoea, increasedsusceptibility to infections and failure to thrive in children. Symptoms of less severedeficiency include distorted or absent perceptions of taste and smell and poor woundhealing.</Text>
            <Text><b>Pharmacokinetics:</b> Vitamin C: Distribution: widely distributed in body tissues with about25% bound to plasma proteins. Large amounts are present in leucocytes and platelets.Ascorbic acid crosses the placenta.Metabolism: readily oxidised to dehydroascorbic acid where some is metabolised tooxalic acid and the inactive ascorbate-2-sulphate. Metabolic turnover appears to begreater in females than males.</Text>
            <Text>Excretion: large doses are rapidly excreted in the urine when in excess of therequirements of the body and after an intravenous dose, about 40% is excreted in 8hours, which is increased to about 70% after tissue saturation. The amount ofunchanged drug is dose dependent; in women the excretion of ascorbic acid appears tovary with the stage of the menstrual cycle and it is decreased when taking oralcontraceptives. Ascorbic acid is excreted in breast milk.</Text>
            <Text>Oxalic acid and ascorbate-2-sulphate are excreted in the urine.</Text>
            <Text>Zinc Sulfate (as Monohydrate): Zinc is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract anddistributed throughout the body. The highest concentrations occur in hair, eyes, malereproductive organs and bone. Lower levels are present in liver, kidney and muscle. Inblood 80% is found in erythrocytes. Plasma zinc levels range from 70 to 110 μg/dL andabout 50% of this is loosely bound to albumin. About 7% is amino-acid bound and therest is tightly bound to alpha 2-macroglobulins and other proteins.</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Indications/Uses</Heading>
            <Text>Sodium Ascorbate + Zinc (Dayzinc) is used for the treatment and prevention of VitaminC and Zinc deficiency. It completely reverses symptoms of deficiency. Vitamin Cdeficiency leads to the development of a well-defined syndrome known as scurvy. Thisis characterized by capillary fragility, bleeding (especially from small blood vessels andthe gums), anemias, cartilage and bone lesions, and slow healing of wounds. Featuresof Zinc deficiency include growth retardation and defects of rapidly-dividing tissues suchas the skin, the immune system and the intestinal mucosa.</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Action</Heading>
            <Text><b>Pharmacology:</b> Naproxen sodium is a nonsteroidal agent. It is a non-narcotic analgesicagent with marked anti-inflammatory actions. It has demonstrated these properties inhuman clinical studies and classical animal test systems. It exhibits its anti-inflammatoryeffect even in adrenalectomized animals, indicating that its action is not mediatedthrough the pituitary-adrenal axis. It inhibits prostaglandin synthetase, as do othernonsteroidal analgesic/anti-inflammatory agents. As with other agents, however, theexact mechanism of its anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions is not known. Naproxensodium is not a central nervous system depressant and does not induce metabolizingenzymes.</Text>
            <Text><b>Pharmacokinetics:</b> {'Naproxen sodium is freely soluble in water and is rapidly andcompletely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration. Because ofthis rapid and complete absorption, significant plasma levels and onset of pain relief areobtained in patients within 20 min of administration. It has a mean biological half-life ofapproximately 13 hrs. At therapeutic levels, it is >99% bound to serum albumin. Approximately 95% of a naproxen sodium dose is excreted in the urine as unchangednaproxen, 6-O-desmethylnaproxen and their conjugates. The rate of excretion has beenfound to coincide closely with the rate of drug disappearance from the plasma.'}</Text>
            
            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Indications/Uses</Heading>
            <Text>Relief of mild to moderately severe pain, with or without accompanied inflammation eg,musculoskeletal trauma, postoperative pain and postdental extraction. It is alsoindicated for the relief of pain associated with postpartum cramping and dysmenorrhea</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Dosage/Direction for Use</Heading>
            <Text>The recommended starting dose is 2 tablets, followed by 1 tablet every 8 hrs asrequired. The maximum recommended daily dose is 5 tablets (1375 mg).</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Overdosage</Heading>
            <Text>Symptoms: Significant overdosage of naproxen may be characterized by drowsiness,heartburn, indigestion, nausea or vomiting. No evidence of toxicity or late sequelaehave been reported 5-15 months after ingestion, for 3-7 days, of doses up to 3.3 g/day.One patient ingested a single dose equivalent to 27.5 g of naproxen sodium andexperienced mild nausea and indigestion. It is not known what dose of the drug wouldbe life-threatening.</Text>
            <Text>Treatment: Should a patient ingest a large quantity of Flanax accidentally or purposely,the stomach may be emptied and usual supportive measures employed. Animal studiesindicate that the prompt administration of activated charcoal in adequate amounts wouldtend to reduce markedly the absorption of the drug.</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Contraindictions</Heading>
            <Text>Hypersensitivity to naproxen or naproxen sodium formulations.</Text>
            <Text>Because the potential exists for cross-sensitivity reactions, Flanax should not be givento patients with whom aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory/analgesic drugsinduce the syndrome of asthma, rhinitis or urticaria.</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Special Precautions</Heading>
            <Text>Flanax should not be given to patients with active peptic ulcer. In other patients with ahistory of GI disease, it should be given under close supervision.Flanax decreases platelet aggregation and prolongs bleeding time. This effect shouldbe kept in mind when bleeding times are determined.Elevations of one or more liver function tests have been reported with drugs of thisclass.Flanax contains approximately 25 mg (about 1 mEq) of sodium.</Text>
            <Text>{'Patients with Impaired Renal Function: As naproxen and its metabolites are eliminatedto a large extent (95%) by urinary excretion via glomerular filtration, Flanax should beused with great caution in patients with significantly impaired renal function and themonitoring of serum creatinine and/or creatinine clearance is advised in these patients.Flanax should not be used chronically in patients having baseline creatinine clearance>20 mL/min. Certain patients, especially those where renal blood flow is compromisedeg, in extracellular volume depletion, cirrhosis of the liver, sodium restriction, congestiveheart failure and preexisting renal disease, should have renal function assessed beforeand during Flanax therapy. Some elderly patients in whom impaired renal function maybe expected could also fall within this category. A reduction in daily dosage should beconsidered to avoid the possibility of excessive accumulation of naproxen metabolites inthese patients.'}</Text>
            <Text>Patients with Impaired Liver Function: Chronic alcoholic liver disease and probably alsoother forms of cirrhosis reduce the total plasma concentration of naproxen, but theplasma concentration of unbound naproxen is increased. The implication of this findingfor Flanax dosing is unknown, but it is prudent to use the lowest effective dose.</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Use In Pregnancy & Lactation</Heading>
            <Text>As with other drugs of this type, Flanax produces a delay in parturition in animals andalso affects the human fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus).Therefore, it should not be used during pregnancy unless clearly needed. The use ofFlanax in pregnancy requires cautious balancing of possible benefits against potentialrisks to the mother and fetus, especially in the first and third trimesters.Naproxen has been found in the milk of lactating mothers. The use of Flanax shouldtherefore be avoided in patients who are breastfeeding.</Text>


            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Use in children</Heading>
            <Text>{'As safety and efficacy studies are not yet complete, Flanax is not recommended for usein children <16 years.'}</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Use in eldery</Heading>
            <Text>Studies indicate that although total plasma concentration of naproxen is unchanged, theunbound plasma fraction of naproxen is increased in the elderly. The implication of thisfinding for Flanax dosing is unknown. As with other drugs used in the elderly, it isprudent to use the lowest effective dose.For the effect of reduced elimination in the elderly, see Patients with Impaired RenalFunction.</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Adverse Reactions</Heading>
            <Text>Most commonly reported adverse reactions: Abdominal discomfort, epigastric distress,headache, nausea, peripheral edema (mild), tinnitus and vertigo.The following adverse events are rare but have been reported: Alopecia, anaphylacticreactions to naproxen and naproxen sodium formulations, angioedema, aplastic andhemolytic anemia, cognitive dysfunction, eosinophilic pneumonitis, epidermalnecrolysis, erythema multiforme, fatal hepatitis, gastrointestinal bleeding and/orperforation, granulocytopenia, hearing impairment, hematuria, inability to concentrate,insomnia, jaundice, nephropathy, peptic ulceration, photosensitive dermatitis, skin rash,Stevens-Johnson syndrome, thrombocytopenia, ulcerative stomatitis, vasculitis andvisual disturbances.Although sodium retention has not been reported in metabolic studies, it is possible thatpatients with questionable or compromised cardiac function may be at a greater riskwhen taking Flanax</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Drug Interactions</Heading>
            <Text>Due to the high plasma protein-binding of naproxen, patients simultaneously receivinghydantoins should be closely monitored for adjustment of dose if required. Interactionshave not been observed in clinical studies with Flanax and anticoagulants orsulfonylureas, but caution is advised, since interaction has been seen with othernonsteroidal agents of this class.The natriuretic effect of furosemide has been reported to be inhibited by some drugs ofthis class. Inhibition of renal lithium clearance leading to an increase in plasma lithiumconcentration has been reported also.Flanax and other NSAIDs can reduce the antihypertensive effect of propranolol andother β-blockers.Probenecid given concurrently increases naproxen plasma levels and extends itsplasma half-life significantly.Concomitant administration of Flanax and methotrexate should be done with caution,because naproxen has been reported among other NSAIDs to reduce the tubularsecretion of methotrexate in an animal model and thus, possibly enhance its toxicity.It is suggested that Flanax therapy be temporarily discontinued 48 hrs before adrenalfunction tests are performed, because it may artificially interfere with some tests for17-ketogenic steroids. Similarly, it may interfere with some urinary assays of5-hydroxyindole acetic acid.</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Overdosage</Heading>
            <Text>Signs and symptomsIn case of overdose (including relative overdose due to hepatic dysfunction), CNSdepression (stupor, coordination abnormality, somnolence, miosis, muscular hypertonia,and respiratory depression), urinary retention and ileus may occur. Children may bemore sensitive to CNS effects than adults.In individuals who have intentionally ingested overdoses (reported in doses from 40 mgup to 792 mg per day) of loperamide HCl, QT interval and QRS complex prolongationand/or serious ventricular arrhythmias, including Torsade de Pointes, have beenobserved (see Warnings and Precautions). Fatal cases have also been reported.Abuse, misuse and/or overdose with excessively large doses of loperamide, mayunmask Brugada syndrome.TreatmentIn cases of overdose, ECG monitoring for QT interval prolongation should be initiated.If CNS symptoms of overdose occur, naloxone can be given as an antidote. Since theduration of action of loperamide is longer than that of naloxone (1 to 3 hours), repeatedtreatment with naloxone might be indicated. Therefore, the patient should be monitoredclosely for at least 48 hours in order to detect possible CNS depression.Consult your doctor if you have taken more than the recommended dosage.</Text>

            <Text>Treatment of diarrhea with loperamide HCl is only symptomatic. Whenever anunderlying etiology can be determined, specific treatment should be given whenappropriate.In patients with diarrhea, especially in children, fluid and electrolyte depletion mayoccur. In such cases administration of appropriate fluid and electrolyte replacementtherapy is the most important measure. Loperamide HCl should not be given to childrenaged 2 to 6 years of age without medical prescription and supervision.In acute diarrhea, if clinical improvement is not observed within 48 hours, theadministration of loperamide HCl should be discontinued and patients should beadvised to consult their physician.Patients with AIDS treated with loperamide HCl for diarrhea should have therapystopped at the earliest signs of abdominal distension. There have been isolated reportsof obstipation with an increased risk for toxic megacolon in AIDS patients with infectiouscolitis from both viral and bacterial pathogens treated with loperamide HCl.Although no pharmacokinetic data are available in patients with hepatic impairment,loperamide HCl should be used with caution in such patients because of reduced firstpass metabolism. This medicine must be used with caution in patients with hepaticimpairment as it may result in a relative overdose leading to CNS toxicity.Abuse and misuse of loperamide, as an opioid substitute, have been described inindividuals with opioid addictionPregnancy and Breast-feedingIt is not advisable to administer this medicine in pregnancy. Women who are pregnant orbreast feeding should therefore be advised to consult their doctor for appropriatetreatment.Effects on Ability to Drive and Use MachinesTiredness, dizziness, or drowsiness may occur in the setting of diarrheal syndromes treated with Loperamide HCl.

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Drug Interactions</Heading>
            <Text>Non-clinical data have shown that loperamide is a P glycoprotein substrate.Concomitant administration of loperamide (16 mg single dose) with quinidine, orritonavir, which are both P glycoprotein inhibitors, resulted in a 2 to 3-fold increase inloperamide plasma levels. The clinical relevance of this pharmacokinetic interaction withP glycoprotein inhibitors, when loperamide is given at recommended dosages, isunknown</Text>
            <Text>The concomitant administration of loperamide (4 mg single dose) and itraconazole, aninhibitor of CYP3A4 and P glycoprotein, resulted in a 3 to 4 fold increase in loperamideplasma concentrations. In the same study a CYP2C8 inhibitor, gemfibrozil, increasedloperamide by approximately 2 fold. The combination of itraconazole and gemfibrozilresulted in a 4 fold increase in peak plasma levels of loperamide and a 13 fold increasein total plasma exposure. These increases were not associated with CNS effects asmeasured by psychomotor tests (i.e., subjective drowsiness and the Digit SymbolSubstitution Test).</Text>
            <Text>The concomitant administration of loperamide (16 mg single dose) and ketoconazole,an inhibitor of CYP3A4 and P glycoprotein, resulted in a 5 fold increase in loperamideplasma concentrations. This increase was not associated with increasedpharmacodynamic effects as measured by pupillometry.Concomitant treatment with oral desmopressin resulted in a 3 fold increase ofdesmopressin plasma concentrations, presumably due to slower gastrointestinalmotility</Text>
            <Text>It is expected that drugs with similar pharmacological properties may potentiateloperamide’s effect and that drugs that accelerate gastrointestinal transit may decreaseits effect.</Text>

Free radicals are highlyreactive and unstable chemicals formed in the body during normal physiological andbiochemical processes such as respiration, metabolism and immune system response.This product contains d-Alpha Tocopherol, the natural form of vitamin E which hashigher biologic activity, stays longer in the blood and is preferentially resecreted by theliver to be utilized by body tissues compared to the synthetic form. Moreover, it can berecycled to its active unionized form, which can be used again by the body.Vitamin E helps maintain membrane integrity in all cells of the body including the nervetissues by acting as the body's fat-soluble antioxidant which acts as the first defenseagainst free radicals in the lipid (fat) phase of cells. It promotes cell and tissue renewalof the skin, heart, lungs, muscles, and liver. It modulates the synthesis of prostaglandinsimportant for the body's immune response.

            <Text>High doses of vitamin E [i.e., doses greater than 100 mg (equivalent to 149 I.U.) daily ofd-Alpha Tocopherol] should be used with caution in patients on warfarin. Monitoring ofinternational normalized ratio (INR) and adjusting of warfarin dose (if indicated) arerecommended. Likewise, those with vitamin K deficiencies, such as patients with liverfailure, should be cautious in taking high doses of vitamin E.Vitamin E should be used with extreme caution in those with any lesions that have atendency to bleed (e.g. bleeding peptic ulcers), those with a history of hemorrhagicstroke, and those with inherited bleeding disorders (e.g., hemophilia).High dose of vitamin E supplementation should be stopped about one month before asurgical procedure and may be resumed following recovery from the procedure, or asdirected by a doctor.Do not use more than the recommended dose.Consult a doctor: If any undesirable effect occurs.If the patient is pregnant or thinks may be, or is planning to become pregnant, or isbreastfeeding. The effects of high doses of vitamin E during pregnancy andbreastfeeding are not known.</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Adverse Reactions</Heading>
            <Text>Vitamin E is relatively nontoxic and is usually well-tolerated. Most adults can tolerate100 to 800 mg (equivalent to 149 to 1,192 I.U. of d-Alpha Tocopherol) daily withoutundesirable effects. However, the vitamin (e.g., at dosages exceeding 300 I.U. daily)has rarely caused nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain/intestinal cramps,fatigue/weakness, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, emotional disturbances, andrash. Myopathy (muscle disorder), hypertension, thrombophlebitis (vein inflammationrelated to blood clot), gonadal dysfunction, breast soreness/gynecomastia, creatinuria(increased concentration of creatine in the urine), increased serum creatine kinase,serum cholesterol, and triglycerides; increased urinary estrogens and androgens; andthyroid problems have also been noted. These effects generally disappeared afterdiscontinuing the vitamin.Doses of vitamin E greater than 1,000 mg (equivalent to 1,490 I.U. of d-AlphaTocopherol) daily for prolonged periods have occasionally been associated withincreased bleeding tendency in vitamin K-deficient patients such as those taking oral anticoagulants. It has also been suggested that it may increase the risk of thrombosis insome patients, such as those taking estrogens</Text>

            <Heading size={'sm'} my={3}>Drug Interactions</Heading>
            <Text>Vitamin E reportedly may have anti-vitamin K effects; concomitant intake ofanticoagulants (e.g., warfarin) and vitamin E may result in hemorrhage (bleeding).High doses of vitamin E may also potentiate the effects of antiplatelets (e.g., aspirin,clopidogrel, ticlopidine) and herbs with antithrombotic activity such as garlic and ginkgo.Vitamin E may enhance the side effects of some drugs (i.e., amiodarone, ciclosporin,and zidovudine).Vitamin E may reduce the requirement for digoxin and/or insulin. Monitoring isrecommended.Orlistat may result in decreased vitamin E absorption. Therefore, orlistat should betaken two hours before or two hours after vitamin E administration. Other drugs thatmay interfere with absorption/utilization of vitamin E include colestyramine, colestipol,isoniazid, mineral oil, neomycin, and sucralfate.Anticonvulsants (e.g., phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine) and/or oralcontraceptives may lower plasma levels of Vitamin E.Dietary fiber supplementation may decrease the antioxidative effect of a supplementcontaining vitamin E.</Text>

            <Text>{'Description:Mechanism of Action: Loratadine, a piperidine derivative, is a long-acting, non-sedatingtricyclic antihistamine with no significant antimuscarinic properties. It exhibits acompetitive and selective peripheral H1-receptor antagonistic activity.Onset: 1-3 hours.Duration: >24 hours.Pharmacokinetics:Absorption: Rapidly and well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Food delays timeto peak plasma concentration and increases bioavailability. Time to peak plasmaconcentration: 1-1.5 hours (loratadine); 1.5-3.7 hours (desloratadine).Distribution: Enters breast milk. Volume of distribution: 119 L/kg. Plasma proteinbinding: 97-99% (loratadine); 73-76% (desloratadine).Metabolism: Extensively metabolised in the liver mainly by CYP2D6 and CYP3A4isoenzymes to form the major active metabolite, desloratadine(descarboethoxyloratadine). Undergoes first-pass metabolism.Excretion: Via urine (approx 40%) and faeces (42%), mainly as metabolites. Eliminationhalf-life: Loratadine: 8.4 hours (range: 3-20 hours). Desloratadine: 28 hours (range:8.8-92 hours)'}</Text>
